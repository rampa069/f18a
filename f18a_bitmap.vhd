-- V9938 bitmap modes: G4 (256 x 4 bpp), G5 (512 x 2 bpp), G6 (512 x 4 bpp)
-- and G7 (256 x 8 bpp), like openMSX SDLRasterizer::renderBitmapLine.
--
-- At the start of each line (the tile prescan trigger) the line is read
-- from VRAM and written, one pixel per clock, into the tile line buffer,
-- which the color module shows like tile pixels.  The line address comes
-- from R2 (page) ANDed with the display line (with the R23 scroll):
--
--   G4, G5:  vline = (R2 << 3 | 7) & (0x300 | y), address = vline * 128 + i
--   G6, G7:  vline = (R2 << 3 | 7) & (0x100 | y), address = vline * 256 + i,
--            in the planar (rotated) VRAM layout.
--
-- Line buffer entry: PIX | PRI | palette select (2) | color (4).  Color 0
-- is transparent (PIX = 0, the border color shows) unless TP.  In G7 the
-- entry is the 8-bit GGGRRRBB color itself (G7 has no transparency), which
-- f18a_color shows without the palette.
